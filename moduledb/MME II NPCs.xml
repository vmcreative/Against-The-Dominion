Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.\n\nIf the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.\n\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 7\nSchool: Evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour\nRange: 100 feet\n\nAn immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.\n\nA prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.\n\nA prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.\n\nA creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.\n\nThis spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic.</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 8\nSchool: Conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nRange: 150 feet\n\nA swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\nWhen the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nThe cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</desc>
